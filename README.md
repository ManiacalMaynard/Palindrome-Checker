# Palindrome-Checker
A simple one pager that checks the truthiness of a string as a palindrome.

Update 2 (2021-04-18): Whipped up index and css files, changed js function to change html rather than simply return truthiness.
TODO : Should consider adding an empty string fail state. 

Current goals are to add index.html for structure and stylize.css for visual design. Mainly this project is for getting used to GitHub. =)
