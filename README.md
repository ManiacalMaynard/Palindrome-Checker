# Palindrome-Checker
A simple one pager that checks the truthiness of a string as a palindrome.

Update 3 (2021-04-19): Added random sentence-length palindromes in text form field's placeholder attribute because... um... reasons? This resolves the fail state issue as well as creates a more fun way to learn other interesting palindromes.
TODO: Needs more graphic umph, maybe a background image or something? Could animate the h1 title or something.

Update 2 (2021-04-18): Whipped up index and css files, changed js function to change html rather than simply return truthiness.

Current goals are to add index.html for structure and stylize.css for visual design. Mainly this project is for getting used to GitHub. =)
