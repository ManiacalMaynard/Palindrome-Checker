# Palindrome-Checker
A simple one page app that checks the truthiness of a string as a palindrome and outputs a success or failure string.

Update 3: Added random sentence-length palindromes in text form field's placeholder attribute because... um... reasons? This resolves the fail state issue as well as creates a more fun way to learn other interesting palindromes.

Update 2: Whipped up index and css files, changed js function to change html rather than simply return truthiness.

### TO-DO

**Need to return to work on visuals**

- Choose general visual presentation: Classy or silly.

- Add TacoCat mascot imagery

- Add title with custom typography

- Possibly add a toggle button to switch between each theme

**Add responsive, accessible code**

- Rewrite CSS for mobile first, currently okay for most but some (Palm or Jelly at 356px) are sub-optimal

- Recode all type for flexible scaling (root and rem)

- Add support for screen readers, particularly the result output (test test test)

**General other stuff**

- Write new output text strings, add some character

- Add known palindromes for the placeholder randomizer

- Would love to add animations to success or failure result such as TacoCat smiles when you find one or frowns when it fails
